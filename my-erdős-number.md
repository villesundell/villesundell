While [Erd≈ës number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is originally measured from co-authored academic articles, Wikidata implicitly conforms to a broader definition, covering all co-authored publications, including non-academic books. The authoritative source for this wider definition is the gold standard (as mentioned on the [Main Page](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)) [Douglas Adams Wikidata item](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42), which defines Adams' Erd≈ës number as 10, referring to [this](https://github.com/rchurchley/erdos-bacon-sabbath/issues/16) source. The key is the non-academic book "[Last Chance to See](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_Chance_to_See)", which he co-authored with [Mark Carwardine](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q897408), an academic with Erd≈ës number 9. This links Adams to the academic circle and eventually to Paul Erd≈ës.

I am similarly linked to Paul Erd≈ës via an academic [Stian R√∏dven Eide](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q101662382) with Erd≈ës number 4, with whom we published a book in 2009 called "[Free Beer 1.0](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q121505012)" with a few others ([Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005D2ZUUA)), giving me Erd≈ës number 5 by the broader interpretation above. One of the other co-authors, [Stefan Larsson](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0RpIUtQAAAAJ) also has [Erd≈ës number 4](https://www.csauthors.net/stefan-larsson/). The book has been [cited](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?cites=17471154990118781681) in academic literature.

It's worth noting that an Erd≈ës number of 5 is quite low for someone like me, who has never co-authored any academic papers. This anomaly, in my view, invites further examination of the current Wikidata interpretation of Erd≈ës numbers. But as long as the interpretation stands, it seems that my Erd≈ës number is indeed 5 üòÖ

Mimicking the format of the [Adams source](https://github.com/rchurchley/erdos-bacon-sabbath/issues/16), here is the path from me to Paul Erd≈ës (via both routes):
